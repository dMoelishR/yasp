YASP is planning a change to how MMR visibility works.

<!--more-->

Currently, almost all the data that YASP is holding is publicly available.
The only data that we currently hold that might pose a privacy concern is MMR.
In the interest of remaining fully open and transparent, YASP is changing MMR visibility so we can maintain this "public data only" status.

YASP will make all MMR data public with the upcoming release (scheduled for 5/1).

Things to note after this change:
* By adding the tracker, you agree to make your MMR publicly accessible.
* The "public MMR" option will be removed, and all MMR data will be public.

If you currently have MMR data stored that you do not want made public, do the following:
* Remove the YASP tracker from your friends list.  This stops further data gathering.
* Send us a deletion request (support@yasp.co) with your Steam account ID (the number at the end of your profile page URL).
