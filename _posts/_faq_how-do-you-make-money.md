YASP is a side project of a group of college students.  As such, we're not looking to make money off the site.

Here's how we're able to keep YASP running for free:
* Donations.  We sell <a href='/carry' target="_blank">Cheese</a> to users who want to help support the site.
* Ads. These help subsidize server costs.
* Efficient design.  We've separated out YASP into components that we can scale individually.  We end up not paying as much for resources we don't need.
* Reducing load.  For example, we only automatically parse the replays of active users, since those are the matches most likely to be looked at.
* Volunteers.  We don't need to pay employees as all developers are volunteers.

Anything that's left, we cover out-of-pocket!
